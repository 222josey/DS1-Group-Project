This folder contains 5 files:

1. **README.md**: this
2. **ds1gp.ipynb**: a python notebook with the code for figures generated in the report
3. **owid_covid_data.csv**: global COVID-19 impact data
4. **Final Report.pdf**: report of our results


**Usage**: To run the files, ensure you have the folder with the python notebook and csv files open in the same environment. Also, ensure you have the necessary packages listed at the top of the notebook installed to your computer, otherwise the program will not run. Please ensure you have a python interpreter selected, and once the packages are installed, run the files in order from top to bottom.
